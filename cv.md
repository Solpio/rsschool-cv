## About me

I'd started learning HTML, CSS, and JS this year in May for myself because I'd an idea to create my own web application for helping me in my business and more focus on my customers. 

Yes, a simple way isn't for me.

I graduated as an informatic technologies teacher, and of course, I've basic CS knowledge.

I've a goal to become a junior Front-end developer by the end of this year or earlier.

I worked for 3 months for myself as an accounts booster in the online game and every day I'd English practice with native speakers from the USA, Canada, and the UK. So, I think my English
almost B2 level.
